The recommended strategy is to design for security from the start. For learning purposes, let's assume you have built an API that must be secured, so only authorized users can perform requests to its endpoints.

## Authentication and Authorization on the Web

touch on applicatons, clients of the identity provider
token concepts

## Authorization in a Spring Boot API

token validation

You don't need to create a client application for your API if not using opaque tokens.


## Authentication from a Single-Page Application (SPA)

enable cors
sign in

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

auth0 flows
auth0 permissions, user management
server security
test server security relaxing the client
