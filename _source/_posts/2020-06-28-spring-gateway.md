spring-gateway introduction

**Prerequisites**: [Java 8](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)+

In this tutorial we will create a microservices architecture to learn the configuration of three common OAuth2 patterns, using Okta as authentication provider:

- Spring Cloud Gateway OpenID Connect Authentication Code Flow
- Cart Microservice OAuth2 Authorization
- Pricing Microservice Client Credentials Grant

## Common OAuth2 Patterns
